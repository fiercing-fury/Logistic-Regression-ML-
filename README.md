# Logistic Regression Project

This project demonstrates how to implement Logistic Regression — a popular machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks — using Python and the Scikit-learn library.

It walks through the complete machine learning pipeline:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Evaluation using metrics like confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve
